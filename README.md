# Simple Time App Using React
A simple React Javascript application that uses API from [worldtimeapi.org](http://worldtimeapi.org/api/) 
to display time in date-time format

## Pre-requisites
1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. An IDE like Atom or Webstorm

## Install and Start

In the commandline,

1. Use `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Use `npm start` to start react in development mode
3. The browser would open automatically. If not, go to url: http://localhost:3000

## Structure
1. React components are placed in [src/components](./src/components) directory
2. [App.js](./src/App.js) file has all the components imported into it. Each component is a section from top of the page and is imported in the order of display in the browser
3. React hooks have been used in place of class based components
